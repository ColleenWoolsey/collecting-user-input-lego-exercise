BOOK 4 - CHAPTER 2 - Collecting User Input

1. Created a form to allow users to define their own LEGO creations
2. Added an event listener to the Save button, to collect the value of each of the input fields
3. Configured fetch request to POST instead of usual GET from the API
4. Rather than the user typing in the name of the color each time, defined another collection in
the API named colors to let the user select a pre-defined color from a <select> element
5. Refactored the lego API data structures
